I HATE PDF - A Clean, Ad-Free File Compressor
Tired of online file compressors that are slow, cluttered with ads, and have questionable privacy policies? So was I. This project is a simple, powerful, and user-respecting tool to shrink your files without the headache.

About The Project
I HATE PDF is a web-based utility designed to compress various file types—including PDFs, JPGs, PNGs, and DOCX documents—to a user-specified target size. The goal is to provide a clean, fast, and private alternative to the ad-riddled online tools that dominate the web.

This repository currently contains the complete frontend UI/UX for the application.
